# HMDA Analysis

## Introduction

This projects seeks to analyze 2022 HMDA Loan/Application Records at the census tract level to determine what communities are being well served by financial institutions and which are being poorly served.

## Data

The source data for this project is the 2022 Snapshot Loan/Application Record. This includes all applications for loans secured by a dwelling made in 2022. For this project the following exclusions have been made:

- Loans for a commerical or investment purchase: these loans have different approval standards than consumer mortgages that make up the bulk of the data
- Preapproval applications: since the location of the property being purchased has yet to be determined, these applications do not include location data
- Loans being purchased: these are transactions between financial institutions
